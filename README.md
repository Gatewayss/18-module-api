# Social Media API

Social media companies rely on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate the dynamic sharing, updating, and deletion of data for their users. This API offers full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and is designed to handle unstructured data using a NoSQL approach, such as Mongoose. With this technology, social media platforms can efficiently manage large amounts of user-generated content while ensuring that their data is secure and easily accessible. 

## Usage 
To instal the necessary dependencies run the following command: 

`npm install`

Then to start the server run the 

`npm start`

Optionally if you wish to reseed the database by adding five users with no thoughts or reactions run 

`npm run seed`
